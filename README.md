# Code and data for stories on The Jakarta Post

This repo contains the code and data behind my works at [The Jakarta Post](https://thejakartapost.com). My older works are not well-documented. Hence, this repo is a non-exhaustive list.

I mostly use **R** to wrangle and analyze the data. For visualizations, I use [**Datawrapper**](https://www.datawrapper.de/) to create interactive web-based charts and [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to create static charts.


## Data

The data come mostly from official sources, such as Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and Bank Indonesia (BI). When available, I use data from international organizations or private institutions.
