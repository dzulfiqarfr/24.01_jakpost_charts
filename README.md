# About

This repo hosts the charts for my stories on The Jakarta Post (JakPost). I used this repo as the external source to embed my charts on JakPost's website (which is not a really good idea in hindsight). I'm keeping this repo just for that purpose.

Find the code, data and documentation behind my (improved) graphics for my data-driven stories on JakPost in [this repo](https://github.com/dzulfiqarfr/jakpost-graphics).
