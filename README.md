# Code and data for stories on The Jakarta Post

This repo contains the documentation of code and (backup) data I use for my work at The Jakarta Post. My older works are not well-documented, which makes this repo a non-exhaustive list.

I mostly use [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) to create interactive web-based charts and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) in R to create static charts. To extract data from (non-image) pdf documents, I use [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) either directly or through R.


## Data

The data come mostly from official sources, such as Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Bank Indonesia (BI), the Finance Ministry and the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). When available, I use data from international organizations or private institutions.
