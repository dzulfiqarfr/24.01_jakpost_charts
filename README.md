# Code and data for stories on The Jakarta Post

This repo contains the code and data I use for my work at The Jakarta Post. My older works are not well-documented, which makes this repo a non-exhaustive list.

I mostly use R to wrangle and analyze the data. For visualizations, I use [**Datawrapper**](https://www.datawrapper.de/) to create interactive web-based charts and [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) in R to create static charts.


## Data

The data come mostly from official sources, such as Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and Bank Indonesia (BI). When available, I use data from international organizations or private institutions.
